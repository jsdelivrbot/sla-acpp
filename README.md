# Attribution and cookie policy for legacy sites under SLA

This is a set of scripts and styles to inject a footer, with attribution information, into legacy projects which are no longer active, but are currently being maintained by [King's Digital Lab](https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk).

To add to a site, add the `script` declaration as the last element of `body`.

For the stable version of the script add:

```
<script defer="defer" src="https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk/sla-acpp/js/sla.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

For the development version of the script:

```
<script defer="defer" src="https://rawgit.com/kingsdigitallab/sla-acpp/develop/js/sla.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```
